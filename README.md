# MemBrain
### Automated detection of membrane-bound proteins

MemBrain is a pipeline for the automated detection of membrane-bound proteins in cryo-electron tomograms. It utilizes 
the geometry of a pre-segmented membrane to reduce the complexity of the detection task. As a result, MemBrain only requires a small amount of 
annotated data (even one single annotated membrane can be enough!) and can generalize well to unseen tomograms and membranes.

### Workflow
#### Inputs
MemBrain takes as an input the 3D segmentation of a membrane, together with the respective tomogram (both in .mrc or .rec format). 

For re-training MemBrain, .csv files or .xml files containing particle positions are required. It is optimized for particle positions outputs 
generated by Membranorama in .xml format. For also taking into account the particle shapes (e.g. elliptic), one will also require low-resolution particle models 
(the ones mapped onto the Membranorama densities), as well as the mesh files corresponding to the membrane segmentations (again, the ones used in Membranorama).
#### Create data structure
tbd.

#### User input
As a first step, the user has to choose, which side to pick particles on. For this, the segmentations are visualized and the user is required to click on the correct side of the membrane. (Hint: Maximize the distance between point and membrane for a more robust side-picking).
Currently, this only works for sheet-like membranes. For other membrane types, you can contact me and we can try to find a solution (lorenz.lamm@helmholtz-muenchen.de).

#### Points and normals sampling
According to the user's choice, points are sampled on one side of a membrane, together with their respective normal vectors. A normal voting procedure is performed to make the normal vectors more robust.

To confirm that the correct side was picked, you can run the script "verify_picking_side.py".
